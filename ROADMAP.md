# universal-cam — Project Roadmap

> Use your iPhone as a Windows webcam and microphone over USB or Wi-Fi.
> Status: **Phase 1 — Foundation** (active)

---

## Vision

Replace hardware capture cards and proprietary solutions with a free, open-architecture
app that streams H.264/HEVC video and AAC audio from an iPhone to Windows as a virtual
webcam and microphone — accessible to any app that uses DirectShow or Media Foundation
(Teams, OBS, Zoom, Slack, Discord, Webex).

Key differentiators over existing apps (Camo, iVCam, Iriun, DroidCam, FineCam):
- True plug-and-play: zero driver install via Windows Camera API + UVC emulation
- Native Windows 11 integration (taskbar widget, no background window required)
- On-device AI upscaling using AMD/Intel AI PC NPU chips
- Multi-iPhone director switching: seamless cut between 2–3 paired phones mid-call
- Spatial/binaural audio via iPhone dual-mic array
- Fully offline — zero telemetry, no account, no cloud dependency
- NDI HX3 output for professional broadcast workflows

| Language | C# / .NET 8 |
| Transport | MsQuic (QUIC protocol over USB tunnel or Wi-Fi) |
| Video decode | Windows Media Foundation + DXVA2/D3D11VA (hardware) |
| Audio | WASAPI virtual audio device |
| Rendering | Direct3D 11 + WIC (Windows Imaging Component) |
| USB pairing | libimobiledevice / Apple Devices driver (Windows) |
| Distribution | Unpackaged EXE — no MSIX, target < 20 MB installer |

### Minimum System Requirements

- [ ] First decoded frame rendered to WinUI 3 `SwapChainPanel` via D3D11
- [ ] Manual exposure, ISO, white balance, lens selector controls
- [ ] Configurable bitrate + encoder (H.264 / HEVC)
- [ ] Portrait mode (bokeh) and background blur
- [ ] Saved profiles / presets (JSON per profile, auto-load on connect)
- [ ] In-app recording to PC
- [ ] macOS client at parity with Windows (CoreMediaIO DAL plugin)

### KPIs
- End-to-end glass-to-glass latency < 100 ms (USB), < 150 ms (Wi-Fi)
- Zero frame drops at 1080p/30 on stable USB connection
- CPU < 5% for decode (hardware decode path confirmed)
- Background blur real-time at 1080p/30fps on iPhone 12+

## Phase 3 — Virtual Devices
**Timeline:** Weeks 11–16
**Goal:** App appears as a webcam and microphone in Windows. OBS/Teams/Zoom compatible.

### Milestones
- [ ] Virtual camera driver (`KSCATEGORY_VIDEO_CAMERA`) or MF virtual source registered
- [ ] OBS / Teams / Zoom / Slack / Discord detect "universal-cam" as a camera source
- [ ] WASAPI virtual audio endpoint routes iPhone microphone audio to Windows
- [ ] Audio/video sync maintained (PTS alignment)
- [ ] Preview window in WinUI 3 shows local mirror of streamed video
- [ ] Auto face tracking / Center Stage clone (CoreML PoseNet)
- [ ] AI noise reduction (temporal denoiser via MPS / Metal)
- [ ] AI quality upscaling 720p → 4K-like (Real-ESRGAN on iPhone NPU)
- [ ] Multi-iPhone switching — director mode (2–3 phones, one-click cut in PC client)
- [ ] LUT / cinematic colour filter library (pre-baked 3D LUT via Metal)
- [ ] Background video replacement
- [ ] Spatial / stereo mic capture (iPhone dual-mic array, binaural AAC)
- [ ] Custom overlay / lower-thirds (SVG compositor in PC client)
- [ ] Screen / window capture mix-in (Windows DXGI capture + phone feed composite)
- [ ] Native RTMP / live stream output (ffmpeg RTMP client)
- [ ] Global hotkey / shortcut system (mute, switch cam, snapshot)

### KPIs
- Device enumerated within 2 s of app launch
- Audio latency < 50 ms relative to video
- No BSOD during driver load/unload cycle (10 iterations)
- Multi-phone switch latency < 500 ms
- AI upscaling faster than real-time on AMD/Intel AI PC

## Open Questions & Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual camera driver signing (kernel mode requires EV cert, ~$300/yr) | High | Use MF Software Device (user-mode) as default; kernel driver for advanced mode |
| Apple USB protocol changes (libimobiledevice is reverse-engineered) | Medium | Abstract behind interface; monitor libimobiledevice releases |
| MsQuic over USB NCM latency vs. raw USB | Low | Benchmark early; fallback to TCP if QUIC overhead is measurable |
| HEVC licensing (Windows HEVC codec is a paid Store item) | Medium | Ship H.264 as default; check codec availability before enabling HEVC |
| Multi-iPhone mode: iOS background session limits | Medium | Use `AVCaptureMultiCamSession` on iPhone 11+ (requires dual-camera entitlement) |
